# Data Visualization Final Project
My website currently hosts my final project for my Data Visualization class that I took in Spring 2023.
The project is a webpage styled with CSS and HTML that depicts statistical research I conducted on the usage of Illicit Drugs in the U.S.
The maps and statistics were all created using Tableau, and the data was sourced from SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration).

Here is a picture of the webpage which can be accessed by going to https://msdege.github.io/Michaels-website/
