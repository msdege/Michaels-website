    	<h2> Parallel Categories Plot Comparing Voting Frequency With Education and Income </h2>
		<iframe src="categories.html" title="Categories Plot" width="70%" height="70%" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
		<p> This plot compares the different observations From this plot, we are able to see a relationship between voting frequency and income/education. Of the people who always or sporadically vote, they tend to be more educated and be in higher income brackets than those who rarely/never vote. Those who rarely/never vote comprise more of the high school or less education level and subsequently comprise the lower income brackets as well. There is also a relationship between income and education which is independent of voting frequency. Those who are more educated tend to be in higher income brakcts than those who are less educated.  Those with some college experience seem to be fairly evenly dispersed among the income categories, those with college educations tend to have more in the $75-125k and $125K categories, and those with high school educations or less comprise more of the $40-75k and <$40k categories.</p>
		
		<h2> Bubble Chart Comparing Percentage of Absentee Voters and Percentage of Voter Turnout </h2>
		<iframe src="bubble.html" title="Bubble plot" style="text-align:center" width="70%" height="70%" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
		<p> This chart allows for comparing across multiple years. Based on the chart, 2020 is noticeably different than the other years. There is a much greater percentage of absentee voters that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This realization may have been made clearer by the use of distinct plots for each year, but more plots would have increased data ink. 2016 and 2020 have comparatively higher voter turnouts than the other years. This is due to presidential elections being held during those years, while only congressional elections were held in the other ones. The average turnout percentages for 2016 and 2020 are 74% and 76%, respectively, while the percentages for 2014, 2018, and 2022 are 45%, 68%, and 51%, respectively. </p>
